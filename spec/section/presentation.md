## Presentation and Example (Informative) {#overview}

This section gives a brief overview of the RML mapping language. 
It also provides simple examples of the generation of RDF collections and containers from JSON documents.

Herebelow we present the three main constructs for generating collections and containers. Other predicates, and their use in examples, will be explained further down this document.

An [`rml:GatherMap`](#rml-gathermap) is a term map that generates a collection (`rdf:List`) or container (`rdf:Bag`, `rdf:Seq`, `rdf:Alt`). 
A gather map has a list of term maps that inform the RML processor which RDF terms have to be generated as members of the list or container. 
The [`rml:gather`](#rml-gather) predicate is used to link an instance of [`rml:GatherMap`](#rml-gathermap) with a list of term maps. The generation of a collection or container depends on the `rml:gatherAs` predicate, which may take any of the following values: `rdf:List`, `rdf:Bag`, `rdf:Seq`,  and `rdf:Alt`.

The figure below illustrates the GatherMap and its relationships with other entities of the RML model.

### Running example {#runningexample}

In this section, the data source consists of a JSON file, `data.json`, containing the following JSON array:

<pre class="ex-input">
[ 
  { "id": "a",  "values": [ "1" , "2" , "3" ] },
  { "id": "b",  "values": [ "4" , "5" , "6" ] },
  { "id": "c",  "values": [ "7" , "8" , "9" ] } 
]
</pre>

The associated RML mapping starts as follows:

<pre class="ex-mapping">
@prefix rml: &lt;http://w3id.org/rml/&gt;.
@prefix rr:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#&gt;.
@prefix ql:  &lt;http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/ql#&gt;.
@prefix ex:  &lt;http://example.com/ns&gt;.
@base        &lt;http://example.com/ns&gt;.

<#TM> a rml:TriplesMap;
  rml:logicalSource [
    rml:source "data.json" ;
    rml:referenceFormulation ql:JSONPath ;
    rml:iterator "$.*" ;
  ];

  rml:subjectMap [
    rml:template "{id}" ;
  ] ;
.
</pre>

Note that the `rml:iterator` in the logical source will yield three [iterations](#iterations), each one providing one of the three sub-documents of the JSON array:
<pre class="ex-input">
  { "id": "a",  "values": [ "1" , "2" , "3" ] }
  { "id": "b",  "values": [ "4" , "5" , "6" ] }
  { "id": "c",  "values": [ "7" , "8" , "9" ] } 
</pre>


### A simple example {#simpleexample}

Given the JSON document and the RML mapping completed with the following predicate object map:

<pre class="ex-mapping">
  rml:predicateObjectMap [
    rml:predicate ex:with ;
    rml:objectMap [
        rml:gather ( [ rml:reference "values.*" ; ] ) ;
        rml:gatherAs rdf:List ;
    ] ;
  ] ;
</pre>

In this example, each [iteration](#iterations) yields a new (unique) blank node that is the head of the collection being produced.
The following output will be produced:

<pre class="ex-output">
  :a ex:with ("1" "2" "3") .
  :b ex:with ("4" "5" "6") .
  :c ex:with ("7" "8" "9") .
</pre>


### Collections and containers identified with an IRI or blank node ID

In the previous example, the gather map does not contain any `rml:template`, `rml:constant` or `rml:reference` property.
By contrast, the example below identifies the collection with a `rml:template` property. The IRI generated by the template will be assigned to the head node of the collection. We refer to this as a **[named collection](#named)**.

The following mapping:

<pre class="ex-mapping">
  rml:predicateObjectMap [
    rml:predicate ex:with ;
    rml:objectMap [
        rml:template "list/{id}" ;
        rml:gather ( [ rml:reference "values.*" ; ] ) ;
        rml:gatherAs rdf:List ;
    ] ;
  ] ;
</pre>

will yield the following output:

<pre class="ex-output">
  :a ex:with :list/a . :list/a rdf:first "1" ; rdf:rest ("2" "3") .
  :b ex:with :list/b . :list/b rdf:first "4" ; rdf:rest ("5" "6") .
  :c ex:with :list/c . :list/c rdf:first "7" ; rdf:rest ("8" "9") .
</pre>

This is similar to the previous example, yet in this case the head node of each produced collection is assigned an IRI `:list/a`, `:list/b` and `:list/c`.
